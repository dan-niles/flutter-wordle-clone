## Game Rules

As a player, your task is to try and uncover the five-letter word that is displayed on the screen. You have a maximum of six attempts to solve the puzzle. For each attempt, you will enter a guess and the app will give you feedback on which of the letters you've chosen are present in the target word and whether or not they're in the correct position. Keep making guesses until you successfully complete the puzzle, but remember you only have six tries.
